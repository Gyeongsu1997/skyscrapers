## Usage

1. Build the program with one of the 'make', 'make all', or 'make skyscrapers' commands.

2. Run the program in the form of **./skyscrapers "col1up col2up col3up col4up col1down col2down col3down col4down row1left row2left row3left row4left row1right row2right row3right row4right"**. Instead of col1up to row4right, you need to put the numbers given in the corresponding positions in the figure below.
